# Twitter_Data_NLP_pipeline

In this project, my twitter scraper gathers tweets and initially stores them in a MongoDB database. The tweets are structured and pushed onto a custom PostgreSQL databse. The cleaned tweets are then extracted and processed with an NLP sentiment analysis algorithm. 
The data pipeline is put together using docker-compose.
